### Helpful Hints
Within terminal there are several shortcuts you can take to auto-fill values which makes it easier and faster to go between directories:
*when changing directories (cd) you can tab over if you have the first few letters of the directory and it will auto-complete the directory you are trying to go into
*if you hit the up arrow it will bring back the last command you executed (this is helpful if you messed up the command and need to tweek it or if you want to execute the command again)
